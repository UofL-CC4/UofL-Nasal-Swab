# UofL-Nasal-Swab
UofL Nasal Swab Data Package
We are running (side by side, (Standard Swab/3D Printed Swab)) testing with COVID19 patients to make sure we do not have a problem with false negatives, this is a mandatory clinical trial required by UofL Health Institutional Review Board (IRB).  Under FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. In accordance with FDA regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. This group review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects.

Here is where we are at;
•	We have developed the Creative Commons License for release of all data.
•	There is an online repository for all related files it is live but the final document package is not updated yet. https://github.com/UofL-CC4/UofL-Nasal-Swab
•	All clinical protocols are established and being followed in the IRB Clinical Trial
•	3D printing of the geometry has been clinically validated
•	COVID-19 3D Printed Swab Cleaning Protocol is complete
•	COVID-19 3D Printed Swab Curing Protocol is complete
•	COVID-19 3D Printed Swab Packaging Protocol is complete
•	ETO Sterilization protocol is complete
•	COVID 19 Test Kit Assembly Protocol is complete and SOP is complete
•	Viral transport Medium has been clinically validated using CDC recipe
We are now just waiting for IRB Sign off, we anticipate today.

We are currently building workflows for different 3D printers so we can roll this out Statewide with the current emphasis going to Lexmark and UK.

I have attached 2 videos one is of a completed SWAB print and the second is on the UV curing rack
